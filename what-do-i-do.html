          <div class="text-primary"> I'm Dawid, I like getting things done and making stuff click. <br><br> My career began with a deep passion for software engineering, where I relentlessly pursued optimal solutions. Over the years, my path shifted from hands-on coding to leading and nurturing teams, guiding them to grow and excel. In 2023, I expanded my horizons by completing an MBA, defending a dissertation that delves into the intricacies of decision-making among tech leaders.
            <br><br>
            My journey has been diverse, from pioneering roles to steering the ship as the Senior Engineering Manager and Site Lead at Glovo's Warsaw Tech Hub. What drives me is the desire to turn vision into reality, to see plans come to life, and to assist others in reaching their highest potential. I work with individuals, leaders and organisations to bring their potential to the next level. Let's collaborate to navigate the complexities of the tech industry and  and unlock new horizons of achievement and progress.</div>
