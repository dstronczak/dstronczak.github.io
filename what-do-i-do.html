          <h2>My story</h2>
          <div class="text-primary"> Hey there, I'm Dawid â€” engineering leader by day, improv actor and comedian by night. <br><br>

            My journey kicked off in the land of software engineering, where I was more than just a code whisperer; I was on a quest for the holy grail of things that work. Fast forward through the years, my career morphed from crafting code to leading tribes of tech warriors, all while keeping my wit sharp and my humor sharper.
            <br><br>
            In 2022 I started my improv acting adventure, initially a playful hobby mirroring my personality, which later evolved into a strategic tool within the tech and leadership arena. Learning from improv maestros like Brian James O'Connell, I discovered how the art of spontaneity could revolutionize the rigidity of tech leadership.
            <br><br>
            From the coding trenches to the spotlight of Glovo's Warsaw Tech Hub Site Leader, I'm here to show that when you mix great engineering leadership with improv unpredictability, you get magic. Ready to crack the code of leadership and innovation, all while having a blast? Let's turn those ambitious visions into victorious realities, one scene at a time.
